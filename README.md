# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

It will be a grid using only flexbox. User will be able to hover over squares and see how it changes.
